											In my Advanced C++ Course, I was involved in a complex project focused on developing a video game using many advanced C++ concepts such as concurrency, inheritance, and the Standard Template Library (STL). As a member of the programming team, my responsibilities included designing and implementing key algorithms, conducting thorough research on the implementation and usage of certain data structures to optimize the game running, and collaborating with many team members to merge our code into one project. This project contains IceMan, a project which encorporates multiple inheritance, algorithims, and data structures to create a working video game. This project tested our ability to work in a team setting, developing and creating different code as well as utilize different code bases in order to create functional working code.
										</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/MazeImage.jpg" alt="" /></span>During the project, one of the things I had to do was to learn how to implement a first-breadth search algorithm into a new system. Using an array data structure and queue, I managed to create an algorithm that allowed the enemy to find the exit after the enemy died. At first, this caused the game to run slower due to taking up a lot of storage and processing power but through concurrency, it managed to significantly speed up the program and manage to make the running of the algorithim work. I also utilized a vector to make the map for game and keep track of the characters. I worked with a high level of independence in my day-to-day tasks as the project was not based on a timeline given by our professor. I also took ownership of specific modules within the project including making critical decisions about algorithm selection, optimizing code for performance, and troubleshooting issues that arose during the development process. Additionally, I actively participated in team meetings, providing insights and updates on my progress, and collaborating with colleagues to address challenges and make decisions. Throughout the project, I utilized version control systems such as Github to manage code changes and ensure seamless collaboration with other team members.</p>
