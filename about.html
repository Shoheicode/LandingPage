									<h3 class="major">About Me:</h3>
									<p>
										My name is Jason Irie. I am currently a college student attending UCLA studying Mathematical Computation. I am a Responsible and motivated student ready to apply education in the workplace. Self-directed, decisive and skilled in reviewing and improving applications and data management systems. Successful history of documenting actions, maintaining permanent records and submitting timely reports. Offers excellent technical abilities with software and applications, ability to handle challenging work, and excellent time management skills. Skilled in working under pressure and adapting to new situations and challenges to best enhance the organizational brand. Hardworking and passionate job seeker with strong organizational skills eager to work.
									</p>

									<p>
										I gained much experience from my classes, learning about data structures and documentation skills vital to any programming system. While there are not opportunities available for community college, I took advantage of the opportunities available to me. I was apart and become President of the Robotics Club at El Camino and the Head Tech lead of the Google Developer Student Club. I participated in many competitions within my school, including a Robotics Expo where students are tasked with creating complicated Robotic Systems with many skills required, including programming. During that Expo, I won with a robot with vision-tracking capabilities utilizing many different APIs to handle/process the images in both Python and C++. Along with that, I participated in the Google Solution Challenge and along side fellow members, created an application intended to help other students find colleges that can assist in their ability to transfer. Through those experiences, I learned many valuable skills and processes that I hope to apply for this job. 
									</p>

									<p>
										I am currently completing the Software Engineer Fellowship at HeadStarter where I am gaining valuable information and skills for preparing to get a job in the industry. I am extremely excited for this opportunity and be able to take advantage of the workshops given. There are many AI resources that will be used during my fellowship that I hope to learn and new technlogies like Google Analytics which can help keep track of extremely useful information. I am excited to be an AI Engineer and be able to hear from those who have experience in the field.
