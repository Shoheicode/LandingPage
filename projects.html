										<p>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/projects/IceMANSPRITE.png" alt="" /></span>
											In my Advanced C++ Course, I was involved in a complex project focused on developing a video game using many advanced C++ concepts such as concurrency, inheritance, and the Standard Template Library (STL). As a member of the programming team, my responsibilities included designing and implementing key algorithms, conducting thorough research on the implementation and usage of certain data structures to optimize the game running, and collaborating with many team members to merge our code into one project. This project contains IceMan, a project which encorporates multiple inheritance, algorithims, and data structures to create a working video game. This project tested our ability to work in a team setting, developing and creating different code as well as utilize different code bases in order to create functional working code.
										</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects/MazeImage.jpg" alt="" /></span>During the project, one of the things I had to do was to learn how to implement a first-breadth search algorithm into a new system. Using an array data structure and queue, I managed to create an algorithm that allowed the enemy to find the exit after the enemy died. At first, this caused the game to run slower due to taking up a lot of storage and processing power but through concurrency, it managed to significantly speed up the program and manage to make the running of the algorithim work. I also utilized a vector to make the map for game and keep track of the characters. I worked with a high level of independence in my day-to-day tasks as the project was not based on a timeline given by our professor. I also took ownership of specific modules within the project including making critical decisions about algorithm selection, optimizing code for performance, and troubleshooting issues that arose during the development process. Additionally, I actively participated in team meetings, providing insights and updates on my progress, and collaborating with colleagues to address challenges and make decisions. Throughout the project, I utilized version control systems such as Github to manage code changes and ensure seamless collaboration with other team members.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Project: TransferWise</h3>

										<h4>TransferWise Description</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/projects/GoogleSolutionImageLogo.png" alt="" /></span>
											Welcome to El Camino College's Google Development Student club flutter application. This application is designed to help students figure out which classes they are required to take so they do not spend more money then needed. Currently, it does not have the full implementation that it needs, however, I am continuning to work on and create more for this project in the future. We are using google technologies such as Firebase, Flutter and Dart to create this project. Flutter and Dart are handling a majority of the Front-End showcasing the unqiue colors and designs that we have found and plan on implementing. While Firebase handles a lot of the Back-End and holds onto the information that is being sent to be secure and held in a secure location like details in the future like Google Account links and more. I will go more into detail about the project and what I worked on particularly in the next paragraph.
										</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects/frontbackendimage.png" alt="" /></span>
											My main role in the project was assisting in coding the front and back-end of the software including the implementation of the Google Maps API and the Firebase Firestore usage. I helped with the implementation of the Firebase system which allows our web application to display data from our Firebase Firestore. Through the utilization of Dart and Flutter's libraries, I was able to properly collect and store the information and utilize that data to display the courses offered at specific courses using a lot of the built in library that flutter and dart provides. You can make very intricate websites and apps through flutter and the utilization of the products. I helped mainly with combinding both the Front-End and Back-End and ensuring both are able to work together and are able to function correctly like sending in the correct locations for the colleges and working on that.

										<h4>Portfolio Website Description</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="image right"><img src="images/index/personalWebsite.png" alt="" /></span>
											This personal website is meant to showcase and demonstrate the skills I have learned in courses and projects to create a complete personal website. These skills including utilizing Flutter and Firebase and using the software to create my own personal website. I use Flutter to do most of the displays and showcase the projects including many different componets that make the website display properly and functionally work. As well as Firebase handling the communications between those who see the website and have questions and want to learn more. The website is constanly being updated and more projects are being added as I continue to develop and create different projects and works.
